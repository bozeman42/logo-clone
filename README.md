# Logo clone
## About
This is an attempt at a logo clone, inspired by The Coding Train on youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-k04yzfMpw

I like to watch a bit of the video until I kind of get the goal and then attempt to implement on my own. While The Coding Train uses p5.js, I just use HTML canvas.

I might have a deployed version here: https://sillylogo.netlify.app/

## Installing
### Requirements
You will need
- [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/how-to-install-nodejs)
- [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)

Download the repository or clone the repo, then navigate to the `logo-clone` directory.

### Running the application
Once you have installed the requirements, install the dependencies by running
`yarn`
Then you can run the application by running
`yarn build`
then run
`yarn start`

Then open your preferred browser and go to
http://localhost:5000

If port 5000 is not available, you can update the port in the file `server.js`
